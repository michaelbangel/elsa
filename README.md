# MJ23R2 Financial Risk Analytics Framework

## Overview

MJ23R2 is an R-based financial analytics framework designed to convert financial reporting data and operational signals into structured governance risk indicators.
The system evaluates:

Variance between reported and verified financial data
Settlement performance and distortion patterns
Operational and behavioral inconsistencies
Litigation exposure signals
Post-settlement re-exposure risk
Composite governance risk scoring (FII)
Rather than producing deterministic conclusions, MJ23R2 generates interpretable risk indicators to support audit, compliance, and governance decision-making.
Business Problem
Organizations often lack a unified way to evaluate:
Financial reporting inconsistencies across systems
Settlement outcome quality and fairness
Operational or behavioral distortion in decision-making
Emerging risk patterns before escalation
Reopened or disputed settlements after closure
Fragmented risk signals across departments
This results in delayed detection of financial risk.
Solution
MJ23R2 solves this by implementing a layered analytical risk architecture:
Financial Data
   ↓
Variance & Incidence Detection
   ↓
Operational Risk Analysis
   ↓
Settlement Intelligence Layer
   ↓
Litigation Exposure Signals
   ↓
Escalation Logic (Triggers)
   ↓
Fraud Risk Indicator
   ↓
Financial Integrity Index (FII)
   ↓
Governance Prioritization
   ↓
Post-Settlement Re-Exposure Monitoring

Each layer builds structured intelligence from raw financial inputs.
Core Modules
1. Variance & Detection Layer
Measures deviation between reported and verified financial values and tracks instability over time.
Key outputs:
Variance Score
Incidence Rate
Trend Shift Detection
2. Operational Intelligence Layer
Evaluates reporting behavior and process consistency.
Key outputs:
Consistency Score
Liability Risk Signal
Negotiator Risk Indicator
Process Control Failure Patterns
3. Settlement Intelligence Layer
Assesses quality of financial settlements beyond completion status.
Key outputs:
Settlement Achievement Rate
Settlement Efficiency Score
Settlement Distortion Indicator
Backlog Risk
4. Litigation Exposure Layer
Estimates exposure risk signals associated with:
High variance conditions
Elevated incidence rates
Settlement distortion patterns
5. Escalation Engine
Applies rule-based amplification:
Double Trigger (moderate escalation)
Triple Trigger (high escalation)
Fraud Risk Indicator (0–100 risk scale)
6. Governance Layer
Aggregates system outputs into a unified risk metric:
Financial Integrity Index (FII)
A composite score representing overall governance risk exposure.
Bands:

0–25 → Low Risk
26–50 → Moderate Risk
51–75 → High Risk
76–100 → Critical Risk
7. Post-Settlement Re-Exposure Layer
Detects when previously closed settlements are:
Reopened
Disputed
Legally reversed
Financially re-evaluated
This layer recalculates risk after “closure.”
Outputs
The framework generates:
Variance Score
Settlement Distortion Indicator
Litigation Exposure Indicator
Fraud Risk Indicator (risk signal only)
Financial Integrity Index (FII)
Governance Priority Level
Root Cause Risk Classification
Re-Exposure Risk Flag
Technical Implementation
Built using:
R (core language)
Functional programming design
Modular architecture (engine-based design)
Rule-based scoring systems
Weighted composite risk models
Deterministic escalation logic
